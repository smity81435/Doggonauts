               <p> With a giant "woof" the doors closed, and the oxygen started,as my panting breath steamed up the glass of my helmet. There was a long silence before a count down started, and my partner in the strap next to me gave a small whimper as the acceleration pushed us back into the seats. The hindges on one of the cabinets vibrated off, and as we approached 0 gavity, the putin-shaped dog treats started to float by our vision </p>
            </div>   
           <div class="storysection" id="two">
               <p>"Comrade! Restrain yourself!" Team Leader Whiskers barked across the local comm channel. Specialist Bernese has already scarfed down three of the drifting treats. <br> "In the name of the Motherland! Those rations are supposed to last us a 18 months!" <br> "Of course Commandant, my apologies," mumbled Spc. Bernese through a mouthful of zero-gravity slobber. </p>

               <p>The trip would take us in  slingshot around the giant grey thing in floating in the black stuff, and swing us WAY deeper into the shadow-place. I'm fairly certain the humans back on the flat place said something about "sickin the bad guys", or maybe that they said "licking the bad guys"... no, that can't be it. Why would we <em>lick</em> bad guys? Definitely sick them. Either way, I was already bored. Not a squirrel in sight. And who is going to pick up my poops? I wonder if human will pee on my favorite tree for me. Probably, she is such a nice human. </p>

               <p>Finding our American human counterparts, in the cosmos on the surface of the red planet. we ran, or as fast as we could. But becasue we had more minimalistic suits, we were more agile, Especially when it came to using our shoulder rockets to puncture the suits of the american astronauts. we couldnt hear, but could see the oxygen leacking out. </p>
            </div>
           <div class="storysection" id="five">
               <p>They began to panic as they struggled to breath.  Dust was everywhere as they rolled around gasping for air, and just when we though we really sicked 'em, an emergency system kicked in and they all began to breath again and retreated to their ship.  While we may have been more agile because our suits were more minimalistic, they still had technology and features on their side.  So we decided it was time for plan B.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="storysection" id="six">
               <p>This was our chance to be good boys and think on our paws.  We needed to come up with something clever; something big; something of Tsar Bomba proportions.  This was going to be our chance to claim the gray planet for Russia and it would finally be the red plant all the humans had been talking about so excitedly.  And so we got to work forming our master plan.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="storysection" id="seven">
               <p>We made sure to check all of the pack was here, and then Sgt. Bugel gave the call, and we all knew what to do thorugh out headset that Sgt. Rotweiler was barking through. we needed to sneak into the American Space ship wait for the airlock to shut, and then ruff them up.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="storysection" id="eight">
               <p>Being sneaky, and tails pointed, the 3 of our special units, Sgt. Chu, Sgt. Wa, and Sgt. Wah went around the other side of the American ship, the rest of us watched through the nose cameras they were wearing. The three little guys made it in, and we listened to the airlock shut, and then, everything went black on the screen back at our base where we were watching on the comfy beds packed for us.  </p>
           </div>
           <div class="storysection" id="nine">
               <p>All we had was audio of scratching, sniffing, and some surprised yelps from the humans inside. when the screen came back on, the camera showed Sgt. Chu belly up and kicking is feet as a human scratched his belly and Sgt. Wah was raiding the food pantry. we were devistated that we were not the ones getting to find our grey planet human counterparts, as the last clip was of Sgt. Wa showed him playing fetch with zero-gravity bubbles of water. </p>

               <p>We had done our best to do whatever it was the hoomans told us to do back on the green place... but to be completely honest we had all totally forgot what they told us to do in the first place. We knew now that the hoomans here really liked us and even had some treats to share with us. One of them has even taken a special liking to me, and I think he will scratch the collar of my spacesuit if I am a reaaally good boy. Maybe someday we can even go for walkies! It is really too bad there are no squirrels out here... I can only chase rocks for so long. The zero gravity does make for an interesting game of chess though!</p>

           <div class="storysection" id="eleven">
               <p>Unfortunately, I was wrong about there being no squirrels. They are just REALLY big, and not very nice at all. The hoomans here also seem pretty upset about the giant squirrels. They keep acting funny, like they ate too much cat poop, and now their tummies hurt. I even saw one of the squirrels come right on out of the tummy of the bald hooman! How neat is that?! I think the squirrels are just really hungry, but they don't seem like they want to eat dogs which is good. I can't say the same for all the hoomans. </p>
           </div>
           <div class="storysection" id="twelve">
               <p>Well... all the hoomans are dead, and its true, I ate one of their legs as well. Please don't be mad! I am just so freaking <em>hungry</em> up here, and there ain't nothin to eat! Cant eat the giant squirrels! Can't eat the rocks! Thats all there is! Giant Squirrels, and rocks. I want to go home now. I swear I will not eat any of the shoes, or drink the toilet water... shoot, I won't even chase the darn cat! I swear! I will leave him alone so much that he starts gettin lonely. Poor fella. Maybe I will chase him but only when he gets lonely. Yeah.</p>
