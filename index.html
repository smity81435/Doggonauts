           <div class="storysection" id="one"><p> with a giant "woof" the doors closed, and the oxygen started,as my panting breath steamed up the glass of my helmet. There was a long silence before a count down started, and my partner in the strap next to me gave a small whimper as the acceleration pushed us back into the seats. The hindges on one of the cabinets vibrated off, and as we approached 0 gavity, the putin-shaped dog treats started to float by our vision </p></div>   
           <div class="storysection" id="two"><p>"Comrade! Restrain yourself!" Team Leader Whiskers barked across the local comm channel. Specialist Bernese has already scarfed down three of the drifting treats. <br> "In the name of the Motherland! Those rations are supposed to last us a 18 months!" <br> "Of course Commandant, my apologies," mumbled Spc. Bernese through a mouthful of zero-gravity slobber. </p></div>
           <div class="storysection" id="three"><p>The trip would take us in  slingshot around the giant grey thing in floating in the black stuff, and swing us WAY deeper into the shadow-place. I'm fairly certain the humans back on the flat place said something about "sickin the bad guys", or maybe that they said "licking the bad guys"... no, that can't be it. Why would we <em>lick</em> bad guys? Definitely sick them. Either way, I was already bored. Not a squirrel in sight. And who is going to pick up my poops? I wonder if human will pee on my favorite tree for me. Probably, she is such a nice human. </p></div>
           <div class="storysection" id="four"><p>Finding our american human counterparts, in the cosmos on the surface of the red planet. we ran, or as fast as we could. but becasue we had more minimalistic suits, we were more agile. especially when it came to using our shoulder rockets to puncture the suits of the american astronauts. we couldnt hear, but could see the oxygen leacking out. </p></div>
